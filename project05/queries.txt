To get existing data for form fields:
  * region_id used to denote the currently selected region from the drop down menu

SELECT wineries.name, wineries.id FROM wineries, vineyards WHERE vineyards.wineries_id = wineries.id AND vineyards.region_id = region_id;
SELECT name, id FROM regions;
SELECT name, id FROM grapes;
SELECT distinct(vintage) FROM wines;
SELECT distinct(rating) FROM wines;

To Insert the entered data:
  * last_insert_rowid() is used to get the id of the wine that was just inserted into the database

INSERT INTO wines(name, winery_id, vintage, price, rating, purchase_date, date_drunk, comment) VALUES (?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?);
INSERT INTO grapes_wines(grape_id, wine_id) values (?, (SELECT last_insert_rowid()));


Wines Edit Screen
  * wine_id used to denote the currently selected wine on the edit screen
  * region_id used to denote the currently selected region from the drop down menu

To get existing data onto the screen:

SELECT wines.name, wines.vintage, wines.price, wines.rating, wines.purchase_date, wines.date_drunk, wines.comment, wines.winery_id, wineries.name FROM wines, wineries WHERE wines.winery_id = wineries.id AND wines.id = wine_id;

To insert the changed data:

UPDATE wines SET name = ?, price = ?, rating = ?, purchase_date = ?, date_drunk = ?, winery_id = ? WHERE id = ?;
DELETE * FROM grapes_wines WHERE grape_id = ?;
INSERT INTO grapes_wines(grape_id, wine_id) values(?, wine_id);
